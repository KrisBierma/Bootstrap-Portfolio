                        <p>
                        I’ve always liked logic games, writing analytical papers, putting together jigsaw puzzles, and creating projects for my students. I love asking questions and am an information junkie. In a way, coding takes a little bit of all these and mashes it together into a lovely career fit for my personality. It’s precise, organized, puzzling, and challenging. It stretches the little grey cells to the limit and is a rush when the code works.
                        <br><br>
                        Working toward an undergraduate degree in English - Creative Writing taught me to hone my writing and analyzing skills. The master’s in education and ten years of teaching taught me to analyze data to influence how I taught. Having taught all elementary subjects, I am used to breaking things down into manageable, well-thought-out steps, and I know how to think ahead to possible questions or problems which may arise. I also know how to make things concise, well-ordered, and linear in explanation. 
                        <br><br>
                        I’ve traveled to over 30 countries. I searched for red-eyed tree frogs in Costa Rica, watched a penguin building its nest in Antarctica, and observed sea anemones in the Great Barrier Reef of Australia. Argentina caught my eye and I lived there for three years. (No, I don’t speak Spanish.)
                        <br><br>
                        Over the years I’ve created, built, or produced many things: written literature guides, built bathroom cabinets (I love power tools), welded a chest of drawers, and orchestrated twenty-two third graders’ individualized programs of study on iPads. Now is the time to build other, slightly less tactile, objects: useful apps, productivity programs, and software to make life easier.
